Hello, world, a far
cry of albatross smoothed
by rocks, by mudded
wave
I am here, world
beyond laws, held by
silences and shouts
and tear
drops darkened
by an unclear dome,

above us all
our heads turned up,
our lids shut and —
icicle

falls from old
skies shattered with
bone tools and soft
eye
bleeding under,
we can save nothing
I
can save you

from the sharp break
of the dome, of the
waves on
that rust sea,
full of glass, sail
half-mast in memory of the Earth
as it once was, but
I
forgot a long
time ago, as did we

destroy wood,
a home to albatross,
or snake or vulture,
or bright teeth, or
a lover
with boots high
above blaze-scorched
grass, glass shield
inevitable, fracturing, head-
bang, belt welt
smash of life under
closed eye.

World
sleeping, a new

vision, we can't, yo—
I
can't build another
I
seep into soil,

tumbling among dirt,
waitwait
another earth
comes,
sleeping, a new

dream
another earth
